## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer who loves crafting clean, creative layouts and intuitive, user-focused interfaces. My favorite tools are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” with growing experience in React, TypeScript, and C#. I enjoy the challenge of turning design into seamless, responsive web experiences.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently working toward my diploma in Full Stack Web Development, and using every opportunity to learn, build, and improve.

â˜• When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually experimenting with color palettes, learning new techniques, or enjoying a strong cup of coffee.


ðŸ›  Languages & Tools:
HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Bootstrap | TypeScript | C#

ðŸ“Œ Currently Learning:
- More advanced JavaScript concepts
- Building dynamic applications with React
- Clean architecture and design principles

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore â€” more coming soon!
